      Our Meals:
    %p
      We believe that the food we consume should be pure, fresh and taste great.  We fully emphasize our meals on seasonal, local, organic and unrefined ingredients.  We source from only the best and ensure that we use the healthiest of ingredients.  We never use refined oils, we stick to coconut oil, olive oil, grapeseed and ghee.  Our kitchen is primarily a gluten and dairy free kitchen, but sometimes we just can’t help making some buttery moist cakes!
